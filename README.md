# Jeff's core Java utilities and application support

Note (move later):

If pushing to github asks for username, modify the `.git/config` file so that
the url has `git@...`, i.e.,

```
[remote "origin"]
        url = git@github.com:jpsember/java-core.git

  instead of

        url = https://github.com/jpsember/java-core.git
```
